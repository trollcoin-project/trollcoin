If you're running Ubuntu 12.04+, Trollcoin includes an easy-build script!

[Commands to build Trollcoin]
git clone https://github.com/trollcoin-project/trollcoin.git
cd trollcoin
sudo ./trollcoin-build.sh

It's that easy!
When the script is done, you can run Trollcoin by double-clicking 'trollcoin-qt' in the /trollcoin/dist/ folder!

For advanced users, the command-line tool (trollcoind) is also included in this folder.
